2/3.
	-Execute schedSim with "python schedSim.py <file> <optional args>
	-Flags -q and -p are not required
	-Make sure that the input file is valid
	-Compatible with either python 2 or python 3
	-Run with python 2.7.6
Questions:
1. For what types of workloads does SRJN deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?

-The turnaround times will be similar if the burst times of the processes are all the same, or the jobs monotonically increase in size (second job > first job, third job > second job)

2. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SRJN deliver the same response times as RR?

-When the burst times are short, and the quantum length is as large or larger than the longest job

3. What happens to response time with SRJN as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?

-The response time grows as the job length increases

Input:
40 17
100 20
800 23
200 24
801 60

Output:
Job   0 -- Response 1.00 Turnaround 40.00 Wait 0.00
Job   1 -- Response 38.00 Turnaround 137.00 Wait 37.00
Job   2 -- Response 335.00 Turnaround 1134.00 Wait 334.00
Job   3 -- Response 134.00 Turnaround 333.00 Wait 133.00
Job   4 -- Response 1098.00 Turnaround 1898.00 Wait 1097.00
Average -- Response 321.20 Turnaround 708.40 Wait 320.20

4. What happens to response times with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?

-The response time grows alongside the quantum
quantum * (N - 1)
